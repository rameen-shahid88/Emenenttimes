      "body" : "<h1>Hello Emenents, <h1> Every now and then, EME pulls off an event that reminds us just how good campus life can be — and last night’s qawali was definitely one of those moments. From the get-go, it was clear that the organizers had worked hard to put together something special. The stage was set beautifully, the arrangements were smooth, and the whole atmosphere gave off that perfect “mehfil” vibe. Credit where it’s due — the planning and execution were nothing short of impressive.\n\nFor the most part, the evening lived up to expectations. The audience settled in, the rhythm set the mood, and it felt like one of those rare nights where tradition and campus life blend effortlessly. But, of course, every event has its quirks. This time, it came in the form of our ever-energetic friends from Degrees 46 and 47. Their enthusiasm was certainly noticeable — let’s just say, sometimes a little too noticeable. While the organizers had created a graceful flow, their excitement occasionally tipped things into a different kind of energy, one that didn’t always match the tone of the qawali.\n\nIt wasn’t malicious, of course — just the kind of over-eager spirit that sometimes forgets there’s a balance between having fun and letting the mehfil breathe. Maybe a gentle reminder on qawali etiquette could go a long way in helping channel that enthusiasm without breaking the rhythm next time.\n\nThat said, the night overall was a success. It had the right mix of culture, community, and campus charm. The planning was on point, the atmosphere was memorable, and even with its little twists and turns, it was an event that people will be talking about for weeks. If anything, it showed just how important these evenings are — they bring people together, they create memories, and yes, they add a bit of unpredictability that only EME can deliver.\n\nAll in all, qawali night was exactly what it was meant to be: a celebration. A few bumps along the way didn’t take away from the fact that the organizers gave us a well-thought-out, beautifully executed evening. And in true EME fashion, it was classy, energetic, and just a little unpredictable — the kind of story we’ll laugh about later while still remembering the elegance at its core.\n\nXOXO -Gossip Girl"
