Academic comeback karna hai? Well, you’ve come to the right place. The Emenent Times isn’t just another website; it’s a complete survival guide to keep you sane during the semester.</p>\n<h2>Here’s what you’ll find here:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"highlight\">Drive links loaded with study resources</span> – Because when the exam is tomorrow and you’ve only attended class 'in spirit,' you’ll thank us.</li>\n<li><span class=\"highlight\">Blog posts</span> – Part survival guide, part therapy session, part rant about why MATLAB thinks it’s funny.</li>\n<li><span class=\"highlight\">Anonymous Rants</span> – Because no one should have to be alone. One small request though, keep the requests respectful or they won’t make it onto the site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We aim to make this site a one-stop spot for surviving engineering life—tips for last-minute assignments, lab hacks, and resources that actually help. If you see something missing or have a cool idea to contribute, send it over! You can submit blog posts, share resources, or give us feedback and suggestions. The more you participate, the better this place gets for everyone.\n\nSo grab your chai, coffee, or energy drink, take a deep breath, and dive in! Remember, engineering may test your patience, your sanity, and occasionally your will to live—but here at The Emenent Times, you’re never doing it alone. Contribute, explore, laugh, and rant… and together, we’ll survive this glorious chaos, one assignment at a time.</p>"

      "body":  "Congratulations, freshies!\nYou’ve made it into CEME (even if you didn’t want to). First things first: welcome to The Emenent Times, your soon-to-be best friend when classes, labs, and deadlines come at you faster than attendance warnings.\n\nHere’s what you should know:\n- Seniors are your ChatGPT – We’ve already suffered, and we’ve left behind drive links, notes, and blog posts to help you survive.\n- Bistro has the best Paratha, Fresh has the best Mango Shake, Pasta, Cheesesteak Burger, VC has the best chai and hot chocolate, and Crusty’s has the best (only) Pizza.\n- The ATM near the girls hostel is the most likely to be working.\n- The people you meet in the first semester aren’t your best friends, be careful of who you confide in (we’re here to be your friends).\n- Don’t make enemies, people can make your life hell.\n\nWelcome to EME life, kiddos, where you’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll question why an assignment has more pages than your birth certificate. But you’ll also grow, learn and make loads of memories, so it’s worth it. This site exists to make your life *slightly* easier: all the notes you’ll need, study resources, and the occasional blog post reminding you that you’re not alone in this academic rollercoaster.\n\nSo buckle up, freshies. The labs may fry your brain (and sometimes the actual circuit), but you’ll find your people, your rhythm, and eventually — your degree. Welcome to the chaos. Welcome to CEME. And most importantly, welcome to The Emenent Times."
