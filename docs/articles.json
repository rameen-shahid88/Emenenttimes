      "body": "<p>Congratulations, freshies ðŸŽ‰ Youâ€™ve made it into CEME â€” the place where dreams are built, sleep is optional, and MATLAB becomes your toxic relationship.\n\nFirst things first: welcome to The Emenent Times, your soon-to-be best friend when classes, labs, and deadlines come at you faster than attendance warnings.\n\nHereâ€™s what you should know:\n\n- Seniors are your Google 2.0 â€“ Weâ€™ve already suffered, and weâ€™ve left behind drive links, notes, and blog posts to help you survive.\n- Group study = group panic â€“ It always starts with 'letâ€™s study together' and ends with memes and chai.\n- CEME life â€“ Youâ€™ll laugh, youâ€™ll cry, youâ€™ll question why an assignment has more pages than your birth certificate. But trust us, itâ€™s worth it.\n\nThis site exists to make your life *slightly* easier: all the notes youâ€™ll need, study resources, and the occasional blog post reminding you that youâ€™re not alone in this academic rollercoaster.\n\nSo buckle up, freshies. The labs may fry your brain (and sometimes the actual circuit), but youâ€™ll find your people, your rhythm, and eventually â€” your degree.\n\nWelcome to the chaos. Welcome to CEME.\nAnd most importantly, welcome to The Emenent Times ðŸš€</p>"
